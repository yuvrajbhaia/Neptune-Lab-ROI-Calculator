# Environment Variables Template
# Add these in Cloudflare Pages Dashboard: Settings > Environment variables > Production

# Google Sheets Integration (REQUIRED)
# ============================================
# STEP 1: Create a Google Sheet
# - Go to https://sheets.google.com
# - Create a new spreadsheet
# - Add 40 column headers in row 1 (see GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md for complete list)
# - Quick version: Copy this into cell A1 (tab-separated):
#   Timestamp	Name	Email	Phone	Company	Total Annual Impact	Output Per Hour (kg/hr)	Working Hours Per Day	Working Days Per Month	Material Cost Per Kg (₹)	Processing Cost Per Kg (₹)	Pain 1 Selected	Pain 1 Annual Loss	Pain 1 Monthly Loss	Pain 1 - Rejected Trials/Month	Pain 1 - Run Time Per Batch (hrs)	Pain 2 Selected	Pain 2 Annual Loss	Pain 2 Monthly Loss	Pain 2 - Pigment Savings Per Kg (₹)	Pain 3 Selected	Pain 3 Annual Loss	Pain 3 Monthly Loss	Pain 3 - Small Batch Requests/Year	Pain 3 - Loss Per Case (₹)	Pain 4 Selected	Pain 4 Annual Loss	Pain 4 Monthly Loss	Pain 4 - Experiment Requests/Year	Pain 4 - Loss Per Case (₹)	Pain 5 Selected	Pain 5 Annual Loss	Pain 5 Monthly Loss	Pain 5 - Recycled Material Savings Per Kg (₹)	Pain 5 - Number of Machines	Pain 6 Selected	Pain 6 Annual Loss	Pain 6 Monthly Loss	Pain 6 - Peak Season Requests/Year	Pain 6 - Loss Per Case (₹)
# - Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL (it's the long string between /d/ and /edit)
#   Example URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABC123xyz/edit
#   Spreadsheet ID: 1ABC123xyz

# STEP 2: Get Google Sheets API Key
# - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# - Create a new project (or select existing)
# - Enable Google Sheets API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com
# - Create credentials > API Key
# - Copy the API key

# STEP 3: Make your spreadsheet public (read/write for anyone with link)
# - In your Google Sheet, click "Share" button
# - Change access to "Anyone with the link" > "Editor"
# - This allows the API to write data without OAuth

# Important Notes
# ============================================
# - Never commit .env.local to git (it's in .gitignore)
# - For Cloudflare Pages deployment: Add these in Dashboard > Settings > Environment variables
# - Make sure to add to BOTH "Production" and "Preview" environments
# - After adding env vars, trigger a new deployment for changes to take effect
